Spacebox is a team of developers and designers that is revolutionizing e-commerce in partnership with <a href="https://packdigital.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pack Digital</a>.

By leveraging Pack's state-of-the-art platform, Spacebox builds bespoke SEO-optimized and fully accessible e-commerce sites for brands in a fraction of the time a traditional site would take to build.

## We are Pack + Shopify experts.
With years of experience working with both headless and non-headless Shopify stores for clients of all sizes, we know the pain points of Shopify. And we firmly believe that Pack is uniquely positioned to solve those pain points for brands looking to take their e-commerce experiences to the next level.

Pack's unified data + content layer removes many of Shopify's inherent limitations and provides these incredible features:
- custom sorting (no more 100-variant limit!)
- built-in bundling (no need for an app)
- first-class metafield support
- fully integrated data + analytics
- developer-friendly API
- and much, much more

Our focus is on mid- to large-size businesses that are ready to grow â€” and fast. We help brands hit the ground running with Pack without having to waste costly development cycles for onboarding and training.

## Customizing the Customizer
One of Pack's best features is the Customizer: a no-code drag-and-drop theme editor that gives brands ultimate control over how their product data and content is displayed with Reusable Content Blocks. Pack does the heavy lifting by pulling in all of your data from Shopify so brands can focus on crafting the experience they want for their customers.

Yet, every e-commerce site is different and there are no one-size-fits-all set of content blocks that will work with every store or in every situation. Spacebox works with brands to build custom blocks to help them stand out from the crowd.

And, whether you want to manage your content yourself or have us manage it for you, we are at-the-ready. <a href="/contact">Contact us</a> to get started today.
